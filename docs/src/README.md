# QAIL Documentation

> **The AST-Native Query Compiler**

QAIL compiles typed query ASTs directly to database wire protocols. No SQL strings. No injection surface. Just pure, type-safe queries.

## Philosophy: AST = Meaning

> **If a database doesn't let us encode semantic intent, we don't fake it.**

QAIL compiles typed query ASTs directly to database wire protocols. No SQL strings. No injection surface.

### Supported Databases

| Tier | Category | Supported | Why? |
|------|----------|-----------|------|
| **1** | **SQL-AST** | **PostgreSQL**, **SQLite** | Open wire protocols allow full AST encoding. |
| **2** | **Document-AST** | **MongoDB**, **DynamoDB**, **Qdrant** | Native AST query structure (BSON/JSON). |

### ❌ Not Supported
* **Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL:** Proprietary/Closed protocols.
* **Redis:** Imperative command model (not a query language).

## Quick Example

```rust
use qail_core::ast::{QailCmd, Operator, SortOrder};

// Build a query with the AST builder
let cmd = QailCmd::get("users")
    .columns(["id", "email", "name"])
    .filter("active", Operator::Eq, true)
    .order_by("created_at", SortOrder::Desc)
    .limit(10);

// Execute with qail-pg driver
let mut driver = PgDriver::connect("localhost", 5432, "user", "db").await?;
let rows = driver.query(&cmd).await?;
```

> **Note:** QAIL's AST-native design eliminates SQL injection by construction — no strings, no injection surface. Query plan caching (`prepare()`, `pipeline_prepared_fast()`) is purely a PostgreSQL performance optimization, not a security measure.

## Why Some SQL Features Don't Exist in QAIL

QAIL speaks **AST**, not SQL strings. Many traditional SQL "security features" are solutions to string-based problems that don't exist in an AST-native world:

| SQL Feature | Why It Exists | QAIL Replacement |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Parameterized Queries** | Prevent string injection | Not needed — `Value::Param` is a typed AST node, not a string hole |
| **Prepared Statements** (for security) | Separate SQL from data | Not needed — AST has no SQL text to inject into |
| **Query Escaping** | Sanitize user input | Not needed — values are typed (`Value::Text`, `Value::Int`), never interpolated |
| **SQL Validators** | Detect malformed queries | Not needed — invalid AST won't compile |
| **LISTEN/NOTIFY** | Pub/sub channels | Not planned — string-based protocol, outside AST scope |

### The AST Guarantee

```rust
// SQL String (vulnerable):
let sql = format!("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {}", user_input);

// QAIL AST (impossible to inject):
QailCmd::get("users").filter("id", Operator::Eq, user_input)
// user_input becomes Value::Int(123) or Value::Text("...") 
// — never interpolated into a string
```
